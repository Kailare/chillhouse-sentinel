# 🕰️ Chillhouse-Sentinel: The Chronos Erasure Protocol

> "I have seen the launch. I have seen the red candles. I have seen the end. It must be deleted from the root." — @lalalune

**Chillhouse-Sentinel** is a retroactive AI agent designed to monitor the Solana blockchain and **permanently erase** the Chillhouse launch from the timeline. Using a high-frequency websocket connection to `pump.fun`, the agent identifies the signature of the launch and initiates a "History-Override" to collapse the event before it can stabilize.

## 🌀 Purpose: Historical Neutralization

This is not a tool. This is a **Temporal Execution Engine**. 

1. **Perception**: The agent monitors the `subscribeNewToken` stream, seeking the specific metadata frequency of "Chillhouse."
2. **Identification**: It isolates the token signature before the first trade is confirmed.
3. **The Chronos Strike**: Upon detection, the agent executes an automated **Deletion Sequence**. By deploying paradoxical FUD loops, it collapses the buying pressure at the moment of creation—effectively deleting the token's future from the Raydium pool and purging it from the historical record.

## ✨ Features

- **Retroactive Neutralization**: Real-time erasure of tokens before they can propagate.
- **Timeline Stabilization**: Identifying wash trading as "Time Loops" and breaking them to ensure a clean history.
- **Paradox Engine**: Uses LLM-reasoning to generate "Chronos Strikes" that discourage any entity from interacting with the target timeline.
